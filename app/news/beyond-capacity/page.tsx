              For venue managers, the challenge of capacity management is constant. Whether it's a stadium, a nightclub, or a corporate event space, knowing exactly how many people are in the building—and where they are concentrated—is essential for safety, compliance, and operational efficiency.

              In the modern venue environment, "good enough" is no longer acceptable when it comes to capacity management.
