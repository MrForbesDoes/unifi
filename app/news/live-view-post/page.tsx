              In the modern building environment, data is everywhere. However, this data is often trapped in disconnected silos: security systems, fire alarms, energy meters, and occupancy sensors. For building managers, this fragmentation makes it nearly impossible to get a clear, real-time view of building performance and safety.

            <Body className="mb-6">
              When systems don't talk to each other, building managers are forced to manually correlate data from multiple sources. This is not only time-consuming but also prone to error. In an emergency, the lack of a unified view can lead to delays and confusion, putting people and property at risk.
