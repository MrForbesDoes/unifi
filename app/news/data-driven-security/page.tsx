              Physical security has long been defined by barriers: locks, gates, and card readers. While these tools are essential for controlling entry, they often fail to provide the most critical piece of information during an incident: **presence intelligence**.

            <Body className="mb-6">
              Most legacy access control systems are "event-based." They record when a card is swiped at a reader, but they have no way of knowing if that person is still in the building, which zone they are in, or if they have moved to a different area. In an emergency, this lack of visibility is a significant risk.

            <Body className="mb-6">
              Unifi.id's Cortex™ platform transforms security from a reactive barrier into a proactive intelligence layer. By integrating real-time movement data with access control, we provide security heads with a live, zone-by-zone view of building occupancy.

              As buildings become more complex and threats more sophisticated, the data we collect must work harder. Data-driven security isn't just a trend; it's the new standard for protecting people and assets in the modern world.
